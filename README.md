# House-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting house prices using Machine Learning models based on various real estate features such as BHK, square footage, location, latitude, longitude, and more. The goal is to build a robust regression model that generalizes well to unseen data, helping buyers and sellers make informed pricing decisions.
