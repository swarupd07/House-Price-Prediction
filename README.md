# House-Price-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting house prices using Machine Learning models based on various real estate features such as BHK, square footage, location, latitude, longitude, and more. The goal is to build a robust regression model that generalizes well to unseen data, helping buyers and sellers make informed pricing decisions.

# Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn)

Feature Engineering & Data Preprocessing

Regression Models:

Linear Regression (tested and removed)

Random Forest Regressor

Support Vector Regression (SVR) (tested and removed)

#  Problem Statement
House prices vary significantly based on factors like location, size, and market conditions. The goal of this project is to create an accurate predictive model that estimates house prices based on available features.
